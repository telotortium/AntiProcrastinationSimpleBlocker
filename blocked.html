            <p>Productivity Checklist:</p>

            <ol>
            <li><p>What is the task? Make sure you're going to focus on one thing at a time.</p></li>

            <li><p>Do you have something to drink? Get yourself some tea, coffee, or water.</p></li>

            <li><p>Are distractions closed? Shut the door, quit Tweetdeck, close the Facebook and Gmail tabs, and set skype to "Do not disturb."</p></li>

            <li><p>What music will you listen to inspire yourself to be productive or get in flow? Put on a good instrumental playlist! (I love video game soundtracks, further notes in comments.)</p></li>

            <li><p>Why are you doing this task?  Trace the value until you feel the benefit.</p></li>

            <li><p>What are the parts to this task?  Break things down as much as you can, until they're physical actions if possible.</p></li>

            <li><p>What are some ways to gamify the task?  Try to have fun with it!</p></li>

            <li><p>What are some rewards you can offer yourself for completing sections of the task? Smiling, throwing your arms up in the air and proclaiming victory, or M&amp;M's all count.</p></li>

            <li><p>What's an achievable goal for this sitting? Set a reasonable expectation for yourself.</p></li>

            <li><p>How long will you work until you take a break?  Set a timer and commit to focusing.</p></li>
            </ol>
